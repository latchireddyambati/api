prior to my purchase of the galaxy s4 4xxxxxx i had been a happy and loyal samsung customer however i have found my recent dealings with repairers to be frustrating rude and to show a complete disregard towards safety on the xxxxxx14 i started experiencing issues with my phone - initially the phone refused to hold charge kept turning itself off unless on charge wlst ts was occurring the phone was auto updating an app the issue continued to worsen with the phone only loading to the samsung screen - i then attempted to do a factory reset- not only did ts not work but i noticed the smell of an burning electronics - i picked up the phone - where i proceeded to be burned after toucng the micro-usb connection to the phone i then dropped the phone causing the screen to smash perhaps the extreme adelaide weather had a impact on ts situation ltscreen shot 2014-xxxxxx at 62939pnggt the repair relates to the circuit boards etc of the phone hence why i also sent the charger that was in i would iike ts resolved,int-sv1appin01-1394141709529-10606,Product or Service Quality issues,0.730342833848,Product or Service Quality issues
