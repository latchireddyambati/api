 - i just cancelled my insurance on two of my phones because its cheaper for me to get it elsewhere rather than pay the 200 deductible  i feel pretty upset about the whole tng because i am sure that the salespeople know that applecare is cheaper than the insurance that att offers yet t didnt even mention it wch is pretty shady  i feel totally ripped off because one of my phones has a shattered screen and the insurance i have been paying for all these months turns out to be outrageous  i could have paid for the screen repair with the premiums i have already spent  therefore i am kindly asking that the insurance premiums i have been paying on my two phones is refunded to me,7.24E+17,Insurance Queries,Insurance Queries,0.0801004599195
