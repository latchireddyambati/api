Citi_Core,ID1190534584,1,"On Thursday, September 11, 2014, I attempted to make a $400 payment to Wells Fargo using the Citibank Application on my iPad. When I processed the payment, a box popped up on the Citibank site that stated the request could not be processed and to attempt again later. The following day, using my laptop, I made the payment and everything was fine.I checked my account on September 13, 1014, this morning, and it registered TWO payments of $400 to Wells Fargo. I called customer service and attempted to cancel the second one, but was told that the system wouldn't allow it. The representative then recommended I contact Wells Fargo to try and handle the matter.Really? The error was Citibank's. If you examine my account history since I added Wells Fargo as a payee, I make $400 payments once per month. Never twice. The only reason I did two payments was YOUR site told me the initial payment was not able to be processed. And now that I made another payment, YOUR customer service is telling me there isn't anything Citibank can do?When I first got through to Customer Service, the representative gave me a canned speech about how she saw I've been a loyal customer of Citibank's for 23 years and how Citibank appreciates that. This is what a customer receives as a reward for being with Citibank for 23 years? It is Citibank that should be dealing with Wells Fargo, trying to fix this problem, not me. It's $400, money I need to pay other bills and now, due to Citibank's error, I have to stress and try and recover these funds?On Monday, I will go to my local Citibank in Ossining, N.Y. on Pleasantville Road and close out my accounts. Chase is right down the street, as is TD Bank. While I realize I don't have any vast sum of money in your bank, the truth is I HAVE been a customer for over twenty years and in no way, shape or form do I appreciate being treated this way. If the error was mine, then I would have no issue....but it ISN'T mine. I work at my job and I earned that $400 and you should be working at YOUR job to recover it, not me, as the mistake was YOURS.I have three young boys and will make sure they know the value of customer service and how, as a customer, they will have the right to expect a level of service from whichever companies they choose to do business with in life. I will make sure they know the level of service from Citibank is sorely lacking and that, as they grow older, they can do their banking elsewhere.Kevin Lynch",2,,Online_Payment,Billing & Payments,1

The problem, in a nutshell, is that you keep assessing me trivial service charges on my accounts. 4981416262 has been assessed a thirty dollar service charge on three occasions in the last three months. February march and april.  64133259 has been assessed a thirty dollar fee on april 1 as well. I want all those charges credited. I've asked you guys to stop assessing me fees on these accounts and you can't seem to do that. Why is that? It's not that difficult. Bottom line, we have 600,000 combined in these accounts and the accounts linked to them. Are those not sufficient funds to avoid these service charges? If not, we have another 2,400,000 in other accounts at Citi. These accounts are in my husband's name and in the name of a shared trust we have.

Obviously this was my own mistake but I am writing to ask forgiveness on the fees for this.  To get a cash advance from an ATM I would have had to use a different card and pin code and consciously decide to take on the insane fees that come with turning theoretical credit into cash, but in this case, I just highlighted something in the same drop down box as the free service I use all the time and wasn't even prompted with a ""are you sure?"" message after.  If you see my account balances, you can see that I definitely was not in need of a ""cash advance"", nor was this ""cash advance"" ever taken out of the account as cash.  Please let me know if you can forgive the fee for this one time mistake.

Actually another 12 USD were charged to receiver of the check and they asked me to pay that as well. On top of that my credit score went down 20 points which is a disaster when you're new to the country and you're trying to build a good score. I can actually not accept that I pay these 48 USD and I ask Citibank to refund the full amount within one week, I chose Citibank because I was told that it is an international and service oriented bank which would care about there customers but what happened here was the complete opposite. I had over 72.000 USD on my savings account when I wrote the check and there was actually no need to let that check return. All it needed, was somebody from Citibank to call me and ask if I would want to transfer some funds to my checking in order to avoid that the check returns. It''s unbelievable, that this did not happen.
