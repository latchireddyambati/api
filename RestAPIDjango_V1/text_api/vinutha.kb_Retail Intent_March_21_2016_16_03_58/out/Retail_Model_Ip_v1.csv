It started making a high pitch noise and we took it to our repair guy. The motor is toast. I can't believe it. I would say we havent used this vacuum more than 20 times. It has to be defective. As I said, we've reordered a different style with a different motor, but I feel that this vacuum was defective. I would be happy to send it back for a refund.

I told the clerk that there are several on the shelf and that I wanted to buy it now. The clerk said that it can't be sold, yet. I repeated that it is on the shelf for sale. She yells over to one of the clerks/manager at the return counter that the puzzles are on the self. That person shrugged her shoulders and did nothing. I am not happy with the whole incident and the lack of concern on the part of the staff. An alternative would have been for the clerk/manager to put the puzzle aside for me to pick up on the 4th..
